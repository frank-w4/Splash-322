# Splash-322
CSC 322 Project #1 - Frank Whitworth and Andy Spiers

## What Pauca Wants
readme file with additional details for construction of the prototype and illustrations of the working prototype. 

## Materials
- 1x Arduino UNO
- 1x Ultrasonic Distance Sensor - HC-SR04 
- 1x Ultrasonic cover
- 4x Pin connector cables
- 1x USB-Arduino cable
- 1x Computer 
- 1x Plant
- 1x Vessel for water (spray bottle)

## Construction
This is an exact diagram of our circuit. We have decided to not use a bread board to save space in our prototype. The only differences are the ports that we mapped Echo and Trig to in our system. <img src="pictures/arduino- sensor-setup.jpg" width="800">

Here we are putting the ultrasonic sensor inside of its case to test how it fits <img src="pictures/first.jpg" width="500">
